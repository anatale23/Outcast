The desert stretches out as far as the eye can see, with endless rolling sand dunes
 as far as the horizon. The heat of the sun beats down relentlessly,
 making the air shimmer in the distance. The occasional gust of wind sends a flurry of sand
 across the desert, making it hard to see anything beyond a few feet.
