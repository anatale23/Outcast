The forest is thick and dense, with towering trees casting deep shadows over the forest floor. 
The underbrush is thick and tangled, making it difficult to see more than a few feet 
in any direction. The air is humid and heavy, and the only sounds are the rustling of leaves 
and the occasional chirp of a bird.
