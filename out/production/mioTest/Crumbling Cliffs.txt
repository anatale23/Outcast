The mountains are rough and rugged, with crumbling cliffs and rocky crags jutting out
from the landscape. The air is filled with the sound of wind whistling through narrow canyons
and the scent of dust and rock. The mountains are full of hidden caves and treacherous drop-offs,
with hidden dangers and surprises lurking around every corner.
