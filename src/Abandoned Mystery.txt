The water mill is a creepy and mysterious place, with overgrown weeds and vines covering the crumbling walls.
The sound of creaking wood and rustling leaves fills the air as the mill wheel turns slowly, 
caked with moss and rust. The mill seems abandoned and forgotten, with a sense of eerie silence
and hidden secrets lurking within.
